We love contributions!

--- name:content pipeline:ssp,markdown

We really want you to get involved in the Fuse open source project, to [join the community](community.html) and help make it a better price of software - please do dive in and help!

Try surf the [documentation](index.html) and website in general - if somethings confusing or not clear, [let us know](community.html) or raise a [support request](http://fusesource.com/issues/browse/FABRIC).  

[Download](fabric/download.html) the code and try it out and see what you think. Browse the [source code](source.html). Got an itch to scratch, want to tune some operation or add some feature?

Want to do some hacking on the ${project_name} code? Try surfing the our <a href="${project_issue_url}">Issue Tracker</a> for open issues or features that need to be implemented, take ownership of an issue and try fix it.

## Improving the documentation

Documentation is massively important to help users make the most of ${project_name} and its probably the area that needs the most help!

So if you are interested in helping the documentation effort; whether its just to fix a page here or there, correct a link or even write a tutorial or improve what documentation is already there please do dive in and help\!

All of the documentation is stored in a GIT repo, see [how the site works](site.html)

## If you find a bug or problem

Please raise a new issue in our <a href="${project_issue_url}">Issue Tracker</a>. If you can create a JUnit test case then your issue is more likely to be resolved quicker. Then we can add your issue to our [source control system](source.html) and then we'll know when its really fixed and we can ensure that the problem stays fixed in future releases.

## Working on the code and creating patches

We gladly accept patches if you can find ways to improve, tune or fix ${project_name} in some way.

## Becoming a committer

Once you have made some good contributions you may be invited to become a committer by the project team. We'll chat to you offline about it.
