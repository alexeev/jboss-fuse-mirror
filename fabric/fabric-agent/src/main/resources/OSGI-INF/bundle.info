\u001B[1mDESCRIPTION\u001B[0m
    This bundle is the Fabric provisioning agent which uses a configuration from ConfigAdmin
    and update the list of installed bundles accordingly.

    The configuration is usually feed from ZooKeeper using the ZooKeper / ConfigAdmin
    bridge provided by Fabric.

    Note that the agent manages \u001B[1mall\u001B[0m bundles in the OSGi framework.

\u001B[1mCONFIGURATION\u001B[0m

    The agent recognize three kind of properties in the configuration.

      * Repositories
          Features repositories can be referenced using properties specified as below:

            repository.[id] = [url]

          If the [url] isn't specified, the [id] is assumed to be a url.

      * Features
          Features can be referenced as below:

            feature.[id] = [name]

          If the [name] isn't specified, the [id] will be used as the feature name.

      * Bundles
          Single bundles can be deployed using the following properties:

            bundle.[id] = [url]

           If the [url] isn't specified, the [id] will be used as the bundle url.

      * Framework
          The jar to be used for the OSGi framework can be specified as below:

             framework = [url]

    The urls used can be any kind of urls supported by the OSGi framework, however relying
    on urls provided by bundles can lead to problems when installing / updating those bundles.

    The Fabric agent embeds an implementation of the mvn url handler and we strongly recommend
    to use those kind urls.
