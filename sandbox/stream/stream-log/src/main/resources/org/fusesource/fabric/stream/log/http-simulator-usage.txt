Usage: (--broker <url>)+ (--destination <name>)+ [other-arguments]

Load Processing Arguments:
 --broker <url>
     The ActiveMQ broker URL to send events to. If you specify
     multiple broker urls, the producers will be evenly distributed
     over them.  At least one is required.
 --destination <name>
     The ActiveMQ destination name to send events to. If you specify
     multiple destination, the producers will be evenly distributed
     over them.  At least one is required.
 --batch-size <bytes:65536>
     The number bytes to batch up before sending log events to the broker
 --batch-timeout <ms:50000>
     The maximum amount of time we spend trying to build a bigger batch.
 --compress <bool:true>
     Should the batch be compressed with Snappy?

Load Generation Arguments:
 --producers <n:1>
     The number of producers to use
 --entries-per-sec <float:10>
     The number of log entries each producers will generate per second.
 --entries-per-sec-sd <float:0>
     Randomly varies the the number of log entries per second
     each producer generates by the configured standard deviation.
 --session-size <bytes:512>
     The amount of session data to store in the cookie section of the log entry.
 --session-size-sd <n:0>
     Randomly varies the amount of session data each producer generates by
     the configured standard deviation.

Other Arguments:
 --warmup-time <secs:5>
     The number of seconds to wait before we start to sample throughput
     results.  This gives producers time to achieve a steady state.
 --sample-time <secs:60>
     The number of seconds taken to measure the throughput performance
     of the producers.
